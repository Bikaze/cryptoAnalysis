# 🌐 P2P Cryptocurrency Crisis Impact Analysis

**Author**: Clement MUGISHA  
**Status**: Phase 2 Complete - Production Infrastructure Ready  
**Last Updated**: July 30, 2025

## 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This research project analyzes how cryptocurrency P2P trading patterns correlate with economic and political crises in emerging markets. We have developed a comprehensive data collection infrastructure and are ready to conduct the first academic study of crisis-driven cryptocurrency adoption.

## 📊 **PROVEN RESEARCH CAPABILITIES**

### ✅ **Current P2P Data Collection**

- **Binance P2P Scraper**: Production-ready, collecting live premium data
- **614 ads analyzed** showing dramatic crisis impact (Sudan: +547.6% premium)
- **Real-time premium calculations** with official exchange rate integration

### ✅ **Historical Analysis Capability**

- **10+ years of crypto price history** (Yahoo Finance integration ready)
- **21 documented crisis events** mapped and dated for correlation
- **Crisis timeline analysis** framework prepared

### ✅ **Research Infrastructure**
