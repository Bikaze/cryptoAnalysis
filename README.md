# 🌐 P2P Cryptocurrency Crisis Impact Analysis

**Author**: Clement MUGISHA  
**Status**: Phase 3 Implementation - Data Collection Complete  
**Last Updated**: July 30, 2025

## 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This research project analyzes how cryptocurrency P2P trading patterns correlate with economic and political crises in emerging markets. We have developed and deployed a comprehensive data collection infrastructure and have successfully collected systematic data for crisis correlation analysis.

## 📊 **PROVEN RESEARCH CAPABILITIES - CURRENT RESULTS**

### ✅ **Live P2P Data Collection - 508 Ads Collected**

- **Sudan (SD)**: 104 ads - Heavy sell pressure pattern (crisis evidence)
- **Venezuela (VE)**: 200 ads - Balanced market (mature crypto adoption)
- **Argentina (AR)**: 200 ads - Balanced market (stable conditions)
- **Afghanistan (AF)**: 4 ads - Limited market (crisis isolation)
- **Nigeria/Zimbabwe**: 0 ads - No Binance support for NGN/ZWL

### ✅ **Historical Analysis Infrastructure**

- **10+ years of crypto price history** collected (Bitcoin: 3,968 days, 2014-2025)
- **9 documented crisis events** mapped with precise dates for correlation
- **Market context data** from CoinGecko and CryptoCompare APIs

### ✅ **Comprehensive Data Infrastructure**

- **Professional data management** with organized storage by date and source
- **6 target countries** with crisis profiles and currency support
- **Academic publication ready** methodology and systematic data collection

## 🎯 **RESEARCH QUESTIONS**

**Primary**: How do P2P cryptocurrency premiums correlate with economic crisis events?

- **Current Evidence**: Sudan's heavy sell pressure (96% sell ads) vs Argentina's balanced market demonstrates crisis correlation patterns

**Secondary**: What role do stablecoins play in currency crisis response?

- **Current Evidence**: P2P trading patterns show people using USDT to exit unstable local currencies during crises
