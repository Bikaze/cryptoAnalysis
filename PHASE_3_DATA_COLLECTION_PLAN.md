## 🎯 **CLEAR OBJECTIVES**

### **Primary Goal**

Quantify the relationship between economic/political crises and cryptocurrency P2P trading premiums through systematic data collection and analysis.

### **Specific Research Questions**

1. **Crisis Premium Correlation**: How do P2P premiums spike during crisis events?
2. **Historical Pattern Analysis**: What patterns emerge when comparing crypto prices to crisis timelines?
3. **Country Comparison**: Which crisis types have the strongest correlation with crypto adoption?

## 🛠️ **IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**

### **Week 1: Historical Data Foundation**

**Day 1-2: Yahoo Finance Integration**

```python
# Implement yahoo_finance_scraper.py
def collect_crisis_timeline_data():
    """Collect crypto prices around each of our 21 crisis events."""
    for crisis in crisis_timeline:
        # Get Bitcoin prices 60 days before/after crisis
        # Calculate volatility and price change metrics
        # Store in data/historical/crisis_correlations/
```

**Day 3-4: Crisis Event Correlation**

```python
# Implement crisis_correlation_analyzer.py
def analyze_crisis_impact(country, crisis_date):
    """Quantify crypto price movements during specific crises."""
    # Load historical crypto prices
    # Calculate before/during/after metrics
    # Generate crisis impact score
```

**Day 5-7: Analysis and Validation**

- Cross-validate Yahoo Finance with CryptoCompare data
- Generate preliminary crisis impact reports
- Document methodology and findings

### **Week 2: Research Publication Preparation**

**Academic Dataset Preparation**:

- Standardize all data formats for academic publication
- Generate comprehensive crisis impact database
- Prepare methodology documentation

**Research Outputs**:

- Sudan coup impact analysis (October 2021)
- Venezuela hyperinflation correlation study
- Cross-country crisis comparison report
